## Snake Java Game

My first game in java, created in December 2017.

## Getting Started

Download eclipse, netbeans or IntelliJ as well as the src files here.
Download and double click UpdatedSnake.jar to play.
Arrows keys are used to move the snake. 
Moving the snake, try to grab the fruit (red circles) on the board.
If your snake hits the grey squared border or 'the edge' you will lose.
If your snake hits its tail, you will lose.
Collect the fruit to increase your score. This will also increase the length of your snake by 1.
Try to get the highest score you can before filling up the board.
When you have recieved a game over you will see your score and all previous scores.

### Prerequisites
